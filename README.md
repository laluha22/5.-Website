# 5.-Website

This project was definitely the most enjoyable for me, as there was plenty of guidance online on how to make unique portfolio pages with user interactivity. My biggest struggle was writing about who I am!  The website tells you all about my other projects and is linked to my GitHub repository (peep the GitHub cat!)

I decided to go for a flexbox layout to display my project cards and included some user interaction, such as buttons taking you to their matching section. I added a burger button to show/hide the main menu, and once you find the burger button, it also triggers the feature that I made as part of my last project.
